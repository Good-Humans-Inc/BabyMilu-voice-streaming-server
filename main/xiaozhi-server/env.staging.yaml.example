# Example environment file for staging deployment
# Use this as a template for env.staging.yaml

# Multi-server alarm endpoints (JSON array)
# Each endpoint needs a ws (WebSocket) and mqtt (MQTT broker) URL
# Devices will receive the appropriate ws_start message from whichever broker they're connected to
